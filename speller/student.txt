MISSPELLED WORDS

LA
LA
LAND
Written
by
Damien
Chazelle
FADE
IN
A
sun
blasted
sky
We
HEAR
radios
one
piece
of
music
after
another
We're
EXT
FREEWAY
DAY
Cars
are
at
a
standstill
It's
a
horrific
traffic
jam
Morning
rush
hour
Sun
beating
down
asphalt
shimmering
in
the
heat
The
blown
out
downtown
L
A
skyline
hovers
in
the
distance
We
DRIFT
past
more
CARS
Hear
one
snippet
of
audio
after
another
One
driver
taps
his
steering
wheel
to
PROG
ROCK
Another
sings
to
OPERA
A
third
raps
along
to
a
HIP
HOP
track
We
move
from
a
RADIO
INTERVIEW
to
a
FRENCH
BALLAD
to
TECHNO
until
finally
we
begin
to
hear
a
new
original
piece
of
music
ANOTHER
DAY
OF
SUN
We
settle
on
the
CAR
from
which
this
new
tune
is
playing
The
driver
is
a
YOUNG
WOMAN
She
hums
along
to
the
riff
on
her
radio
then
starts
SINGING
Then
she
EXITS
her
car
Then
she
starts
MOVING
down
the
lane
One
by
one
more
DRIVERS
join
her
SINGING
and
DANCING
along
Without
a
single
cut
we've
found
ourselves
in
a
FULL
FLEDGED
MUSICAL
NUMBER
Drivers
leap
on
car
tops
dance
Jerome
Robbins
style
making
use
of
the
road
and
the
hot
gleam
of
the
automobiles
Arms
swaying
feet
banging
dancers
darting
as
the
MUSIC
blasts
We
WEAVE
and
SWIRL
and
DART
between
and
around
the
cars
taking
the
magic
in
Finally
all
the
drivers
swing
back
into
their
vehicles
and
the
song
comes
to
a
dramatic
stop
Flash
title
card
WINTER
We
settle
on
a
new
car
A
Dodge
Riviera
In
it
is
SEBASTIAN
L
A
native
He's
listening
to
the
radio
He's
playing
a
track
on
his
music
system
a
tape
of
Thelonious
Monk's
Japanese
Folk
Song
But
he
keeps
stopping
it
over
and
over
and
over
always
rewinding
to
the
same
exact
spot
Revision
OMIT
We
DRIFT
from
his
car
to
one
further
up
ahead
A
light
green
Prius
Inside
is
MIA
Nevada
raised
Six
years
of
no
in
L
A
have
toughened
her
but
she's
still
a
dreamer
She
seems
to
be
on
the
phone
speaking
into
her
car's
system
Fast
fiery
full
of
energy
MIA
and
I
swear
to
God
she
was
wrecked
It
was
pure
insanity
Mia
stops
Thinks
Mutters
to
herself
Insanity
Then
leans
down
and
grabs
a
piece
of
paper
from
the
passenger
seat
It's
a
SCRIPT
MIA
CONT'D
reading
now
Pure
lunacy
Oh
God
I
know
Just
then
the
traffic
around
Mia
starts
to
let
up
She's
too
focused
on
her
lines
to
notice
Then
a
long
sustained
honk
behind
her
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT
Mia
comes
to
Jerked
back
to
reality
The
honking
car
behind
her
swerves
into
the
next
lane
It's
Sebastian
Mia
gives
him
the
finger
We
then
FOLLOW
her
as
she
drives
OMIT
OMIT
INT
COFFEE
SHOP
DAY
Mia
works
photos
of
Hollywood
icons
on
the
wall
behind
her
as
CUSTOMER
This
doesn't
taste
like
almond
milk
MIA
Don't
worry
it
is
I
know
sometimes
it
CUSTOMER
Can
I
see
the
carton
Mia
hands
it
over
The
Customer
looks
CUSTOMER
CONT'D
I'll
have
a
black
coffee
Mia
gets
the
coffee
Quickly
sneaks
a
look
at
a
script
hidden
underneath
her
counter
The
same
one
we
saw
in
her
car
Revision
She
hands
the
coffee
to
the
Customer
We
follow
the
Customer
out
through
the
door
as
a
WOMAN
walks
into
the
shop
We
don't
see
the
Woman's
face
but
we
see
all
the
eyes
in
the
shop
turn
immediately
to
her
We
see
one
CUSTOMER
whisper
to
another
discreetly
pointing
as
the
WOMAN
passes
by
WOMAN
Cappuccino
please
Mia
nods
Gets
it
made
The
Manager
takes
it
from
her
MANAGER
On
us
WOMAN
No
I
insist
She
pays
Then
smiles
at
Mia
and
drops
a
bill
in
the
tip
jar
Mia
watches
as
the
Woman
walks
off
is
joined
by
a
STUDIO
EMPLOYEE
on
a
golf
cart
outside
we
realize
this
coffee
shop
is
on
a
STUDIO
LOT
and
is
driven
away
Then
Mia's
phone
rings
It
reads
MOM
Mia
presses
IGNORE
and
the
time
pops
up
on
the
phone's
screen
MIA
Shit
Removing
her
apron
and
hurrying
out
turning
back
as
MANAGER
Where
do
you
think
you're
going
MIA
It's
five
past
MANAGER
You'd
better
be
here
early
tomorrow
MIA
Ok
then
realizes
she
doesn't
have
her
script
runs
back
to
grab
it
hurries
on
and
then
CRASHES
into
a
table
Coffee
and
food
spill
all
over
her
shirt
and
all
at
once
we're
INT
AUDITION
ROOM
DAY
Mia's
in
a
thick
winter
coat
covering
her
stained
shirt
On
her
cell
loudly
laughing
while
her
adrenaline
surges
MIA
CONT'D
And
I
swear
to
God
she
was
wrecked
It
was
pure
lunacy
Oh
God
I
know
